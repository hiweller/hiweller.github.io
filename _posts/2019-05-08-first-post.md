This will either turn out to be an infrequent chronicle of me slowly learning to be a better scientist, or the GitHub equivalent of a those journals you find in horror games that start off mild and slowly descend into chaos until entry 97 reads something like "update: time machine is working again. i can prevent all of this from ever happening" followed by a bunch of scattered dead pixels. 

Or I'll forget about, I guess. I hope not. Thankfully I can just use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), otherwise this would be dead in the water.
