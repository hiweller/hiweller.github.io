This will either turn out to be an infrequent chronicle of me slowly learning to be a better scientist, or the GitHub equivalent of a mad scientist's journal that slowly descends into chaos until entry 97 reads something like "none of them, none of them understand it, how could they possibly, I'll make them see, everyone will see" and so on.

Or I'll forget about, I guess. I hope not. Thankfully I can just use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), otherwise this would be dead in the water.
