This is the first post for [hiweller.github.io][site], a personal website I plan to use as a repository for:

  1. Providing a landing page for my professional info and research interests.
  2. Logging progress on active research projects.
  3. Accessing information on previous projects and publications.
  4. Maintaining an up-to-date version of my CV (ha!).
  5. Hosting any code/methods tutorials in a central place.
  6. Anything else that, you know, anything else I want to put on here, I guess.

I think that's all there is to say!

Oh, except that if my 11th grade English teacher ever finds this page: Mr. Jampol, I really am sorry about all the commas. I think this is just how my brain is. In my defense, [brevity is for the weak][idle-words].
