I'd like to start using this site more as a repository for tutorial code. I answer a lot of similar coding & color analysis questions over email, and every time I do, I think for a second about how much easier it would be if I could just reply with a link to a page where I already answered this question. But of course that requires not just knowing how to use GitHub pages, but having enough practice with it that it's just as easy to write up a new post as it is to respond to an email. So...here goes. I can always delete this one!
