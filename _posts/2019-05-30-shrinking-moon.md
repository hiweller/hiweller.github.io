# Hey the moon is shrinking?

Are we worried about [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0362-2)?

The moon, shrinking?

Is this bad? It doesn't seem good! Is it because we took the moon for granted? It is hard to believe that a disaster of this scale so close to Earth isn't our fault somehow. I guess we can't do anything, but it really puts a sour twist on the vibe.
