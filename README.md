# What is this?

The GitHub Pages site repository for Hannah Weller (me), a [graduate student in the Brown University Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.brown.edu/academics/ecology-and-evolutionary-biology/people/faculty)<sup>1</sup>.

### What's in it?

1. An about page with my professional info and research interests.
2. A CV page with my CV on it.
3. Brief descriptions of my research projects, ongoing and published.
4. Tutorials and help pages as needed.
5. Whatever.

### Who is it for?

It's for me (Hannah Weller) to store information relevant to my research career. The tutorials and code posts are for people trying to use my [R](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=colordistance) [packages](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=countcolors), recreate my results, or otherwise troubleshoot my code. The CV, about page, and research project descriptions are to make myself accessible as an academic creature, and also to keep me honest.

### Should I use GitHub Pages?

Well, I like it, but I thrive on frustration.
